This Chrome extension's main feature is to map your keyboard's media keys (previous, play/pause, next) to [Overcast](https://overcast.fm)'s web player.

In addition to media key support, there is one option:

* "Open links in new tabs" - This feature is off by default and simply makes the three links below the player open in new tabs.

This feature can be enabled or disabled by clicking "Options" in Chrome's "Extensions" area and reloading any already open episode pages on Overcast's site.

You can install the extension [here in the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/media-keys-for-overcast/iomjboggdipkbeddinniaoiffjibdach). After installing the extension, reload any tabs already on Overcast's site and your media keys will start working. Keys work globally by default, but can be restricted to only be available while in Chrome by clicking the "Keyboard Shortcuts" link at the bottom of your Extensions preference page in Chrome.

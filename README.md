This Chrome extension maps your keyboard's media keys (previous, play/pause, next) to [Overcast](https://overcast.fm)'s web player.

You can install the extension [here in the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/media-keys-for-overcast/iomjboggdipkbeddinniaoiffjibdach). After installing the extension, reload any tabs already on Overcast's site and your media keys will start working. Keys work globally by default, but can be restricted to only be available while in Chrome by clicking the "Keyboard Shortcuts" link at the bottom of your Extensions preference page in Chrome.

The previous key rewinds 15 seconds and the next key fast forwards 30 seconds. This may become configurable in the future.
